# Programming-Problems
Some public problems I found over the web and tried to solve as practice (and to keep myself from forgetting language fundamentals).

# Executing
Usually I use [repl.it](repl.it) or a Sublime plugin to execute my solution code. If the site or plugin is too slow, I use the command line.
